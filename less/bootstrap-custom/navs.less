  * @description
  * Navs available in Bootstrap have shared markup, starting with the base `.nav`
  * class, as well as shared states. Swap modifier classes to switch between
  * each style.
  *
  * #### Using navs for tab panels requires JavaScript tabs plugin
  * For tabs with tabbable areas, you must use the tabs JavaScript plugin.
  * The markup will also require additional role and ARIA attributes â€“ see the
  * plugin's example markup for further details.
  *
  * #### Make navs used as navigation accessible
  * If you are using navs to provide a navigation bar, be sure to add a
  * `role="navigation"` to the most logical parent container of the `<ul>`, or
  * wrap a `<nav>` element around the whole navigation. Do not add the role to
  * the `<ul>` itself, as this would prevent it from being announced as an actual
  * list by assistive technologies.

  * Easily make tabs or pills equal widths of their parent at screens wider than
  * 768px with `.nav-justified`. On smaller screens, the nav links are stacked.
  *
  * **Justified navbar nav links are currently not supported.**
  *
  * #### Safari and responsive justified navs
  * As of v8.0, Safari exhibits a bug in which resizing your browser
  * horizontally causes rendering errors in the justified nav that are cleared
  * upon refreshing. This bug is also shown in the justified nav example.

  * For any nav component (tabs or pills), add `.disabled` for gray links and
  * no hover effects.
  *
  * #### Link functionality not impacted
  * This class will only change the `<a>`'s appearance, not its functionality.
  * Use custom JavaScript to disable links here.
