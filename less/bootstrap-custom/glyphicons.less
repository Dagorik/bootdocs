  * @description
  * Includes over 250 glyphs in font format from the Glyphicon Halflings set.
  * Glyphicons Halflings are normally not available for free, but their creator
  * has made them available for Bootstrap free of cost. As a thank you, we only
  * ask that you include a link back to Glyphicons whenever possible.

  * ## How to use
  * For performance reasons, all icons require a base class and individual icon
  * class. To use, place the following code just about anywhere. Be sure to leave
  * a space between the icon and text for proper padding.
  * #### Don't mix with other components
  * Icon classes cannot be directly combined with other components. They should
  * not be used along with other classes on the same element. Instead, add a
  * nested <span> and apply the icon classes to the <span>.
  * #### Only for use on empty elements
  * Icon classes should only be used on elements that contain no text content
  * and have no child elements.
  * #### Changing the icon font location
  * Bootstrap assumes icon font files will be located in the ../fonts/ directory,
  * relative to the compiled CSS files. Moving or renaming those font files means
  * updating the CSS in one of three ways:
  * * Change the @icon-font-path and/or @icon-font-name variables in the source Less files.
  * * Utilize the relative URLs option provided by the Less compiler.
  * * Change the url() paths in the compiled CSS.
  * #### Accessible icons
  * Modern versions of assistive technologies will announce CSS generated content,
  * as well as specific Unicode characters. To avoid unintended and confusing output
  * in screen readers (particularly when icons are used purely for decoration),
  * we hide them with the aria-hidden="true" attribute.
  *
  * If you're using an icon to convey meaning (rather than only as a decorative element),
  * ensure that this meaning is also conveyed to assistive technologies â€“ for instance,
  * include additional content, visually hidden with the .sr-only class.
  *
  * If you're creating controls with no other text (such as a `<button>` that only
  * contains an icon), you should always provide alternative content to identify
  * the purpose of the control, so that it will make sense to users of assistive
  * technologies. In this case, you could add an aria-label attribute on the control itself.
