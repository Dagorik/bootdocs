/**
  * @stylesheet progress-bars.less Progress bars
  * @parent components 16
  *
  * Provide up-to-date feedback on the progress of a workflow or action with simple yet flexible progress bars.
  *
  * ### Cross-browser compatibility
  * Progress bars use CSS3 transitions and animations to achieve some of their effects. These features are not supported in Internet Explorer 9 and below or older versions of Firefox. Opera 12 does not support animations.
  *
  * ## Basic example
  * Default progress bar.
  *
  * ```
  * <div class="progress">
  *  <div class="progress-bar" role="progressbar" aria-valuenow="60" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100" style="width: 60%;">
  *   <span class="sr-only">60% Complete</span>
  *  </div>
  * </div>
  * ```
  * 
  * @demo demos/progress-bars/demo.html
  * 
  * ## With label
  * Remove the `<span>` with `.sr-only` class from within the progress bar to show a visible percentage.
  *
  * @demo demos/progress-bars-with-label/demo1.html
  *
  * To ensure that the label text remains legible even for low percentages, consider adding a `min-width` to the progress bar.

  * @demo demos/progress-bars-with-label/demo2.html
  *
  * ## Contextual alternatives
  * Progress bars use some of the same button and alert classes for consistent styles.
  * 
  * @demo demos/progress-bars-contextual/demo.html
  *
  * ## Striped
  * Uses a gradient to create a striped effect. Not available in IE9 and below.
  * 
  * @demo demos/progress-bars-striped/demo.html
  *
  * ## Animated
  * Add `.active` to `.progress-bar-striped` to animate the stripes right to left. Not available in IE9 and below.
  * 
  * @demo demos/progress-bars-aninmated/demo.html
  *
  * ## Stacked
  * Place multiple bars into the same `.progress` to stack them.
