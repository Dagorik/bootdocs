  * ## Responsive Images
  * Images in Bootstrap 3 can be made responsive-friendly via the addition of
  * the `.img-responsive` class. This applies `max-width: 100%;`, `height: auto`;
  * and `display: block;` to the image so that it scales nicely to the parent element.
  *
  * #### SVG images and IE 8-10
  * In Internet Explorer 8-10, SVG images with .img-responsive are
  * disproportionately sized. To fix this, add width: 100% \9; where necessary.
  * Bootstrap doesn't apply this automatically as it causes complications to
  * other image formats.
  * ```
  * <img src="..." class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image">
  * ```
